# Chapter 10 Summary: Prudential Rules for Debt Management Firms

## Overview
This chapter establishes prudential requirements for debt management firms and certain not-for-profit debt advice bodies to ensure they maintain adequate financial resources. The rules build on FCA threshold conditions and Principle 4, requiring firms to meet ongoing solvency requirements and maintain sufficient prudential resources to protect customers and ensure business resilience.

## Key Points and Main Findings

### Application and Scope
- **Applies to:** Debt management firms and not-for-profit debt advice bodies holding (or projecting to hold) £1 million+ in client money
- **Exemption:** Professional firms whose main business is their profession (≥50% income from professional fees) and whose regulated activities are incidental

### Core Requirements
- **General solvency requirement:** Firms must meet liabilities as they fall due at all times
- **Prudential resources requirement:** Firms must maintain prudential resources ≥ their calculated requirement
- **Minimum threshold:** Higher of £5,000 or calculated percentage of debts under management

### Calculation Methodology
- **Tiered percentage structure:**
  - 0.25% of first £5 million of debts under management
  - 0.15% of next £95 million
  - 0.05% of remaining value
- **Annual calculation:** Required on accounting reference date each year
- **Recalculation trigger:** Required if debts under management increase by >15%

### Eligible Prudential Resources
- **Included items:**
  - Share capital (fully paid)
  - Capital accounts (sole traders/partnerships)
  - Audited reserves and verified interim profits
  - Revaluation reserves
  - Qualifying subordinated loans/debt
- **Deducted items:**
  - Investments in own shares/subsidiaries
  - Intangible assets
  - Interim net losses

### Regulatory Implications

- Firms must notify FCA within 14 days of any change in prudential resources requirement
- Standards aim to ensure firms can cover operational failures, pay redress, and maintain customer confidence
- Provides cushion against disruption if firm ceases trading

### Practical Application
