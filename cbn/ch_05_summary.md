# Chapter 5: Responsible Lending - Summary

## Overview
This chapter of the Consumer Credit sourcebook (CONC 5) establishes comprehensive rules and guidance for responsible lending practices, focusing primarily on creditworthiness assessments for consumer credit agreements and peer-to-peer (P2P) lending arrangements. The chapter has been significantly revised, with several sections deleted and replaced by detailed requirements in sections 5.2A and 5.5A.

## Key Points and Main Findings

### Creditworthiness Assessment Requirements (Section 5.2A)
- **Mandatory assessment** required before:
  - Entering into regulated credit agreements
  - Significantly increasing credit amounts
  - Significantly increasing credit limits for running-account credit
- **Dual risk consideration**:
  - Credit risk (likelihood of non-repayment)
  - Affordability risk (customer's ability to repay without financial hardship)
- **Income and expenditure analysis** must include:
  - Current income determination or reasonable estimates
  - Non-discretionary expenditure assessment
  - Consideration of foreseeable changes in financial circumstances
- **Prohibited practices**:
  - Cannot rely on guarantees/security when assessing affordability
  - Must not complete application forms without customer consent
  - Must reject applications where customer dishonesty is suspected

### P2P Lending Requirements (Section 5.5A)
- **Parallel obligations** for P2P platforms operating electronic lending systems
- **Similar assessment framework** to traditional lending with adaptations for P2P context
- **Platform responsibilities** include:
  - Conducting creditworthiness assessments for borrowers
  - Assessing guarantors where applicable
  - Informing lenders of suspected borrower dishonesty
- **Specific considerations** for business borrowers and joint borrowers

### Proportionality Principle
- **Assessment scope** must be proportionate to:
  - Credit amount and duration
  - Total cost of credit
  - Customer's financial circumstances
  - Potential adverse consequences of non-payment
- **Information requirements** vary based on:
  - Level of affordability risk
  - Complexity of the credit product
  - Customer vulnerability indicators

### Credit Broker Conduct (Section 5.4)
- **Customer-focused approach** required when giving advice or recommendations
- **Due regard** to affordability and suitability factors
- **Market search obligations** when undertaking to search product markets

## Important Details and Conclusions

### Governance and Record-keeping
- Firms must establish **written policies and procedures** for creditworthiness assessments
- **Regular review and assessment** of policy effectiveness required
- **Comprehensive record-keeping** to demonstrate compliance with assessment requirements
- **Senior management approval** needed for policies (except sole traders)

### Special Circumstances
- **Vulnerable customers**: Enhanced consideration for those with mental health difficulties or capacity limitations
- **Joint borrowers**: May require individual assessments for each borrower
- **Business lending**: Can consider business plans and resources, but assessments cannot rely solely on projections
- **Guarantor assessments**: Separate evaluation required focusing on potential financial impact

### Exemptions
The rules do not apply to:
- Certain pawn agreements with limited liability
- Current account overrunning situations
- Non-commercial agreements
- Small borrower-lender-supplier restricted-use credit agreements

### Key Compliance Themes
1. **Evidence-based decision making**: Assessments must be based on sufficient, verified information
2. **Forward-looking analysis**: Must consider likely future changes in customer circumstances
3. **Holistic evaluation**: Cannot ignore non-discretionary expenditure or rely solely on income statements
4. **Proportionate approach**: More rigorous assessment for higher-risk credit products
5. **Consumer protection focus**: Preventing lending that would cause financial hardship

The chapter establishes a comprehensive framework ensuring responsible lending practices while maintaining flexibility for firms to adapt their approaches to different credit products and customer circumstances.
