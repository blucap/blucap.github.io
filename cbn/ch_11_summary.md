## Important Details and Conclusions

1. **Disclosure Requirements**: Firms must inform consumers about cancellation rights in a durable medium before or immediately after contract binding

2. **Record Keeping**: Firms must maintain adequate records of cancellation exercises for at least 3 years

3. **Voluntary Extensions**: Firms may offer longer cancellation periods but must ensure terms are at least as favorable as regulatory requirements

4. **P2P Specifics**: Does not apply to P2P agreements exceeding £60,260 (except residential renovation agreements)

5. **Electronic Communications**: For P2P agreements, electronic withdrawal notices are considered received at time of sending

6. **Set-off Rights**: Sums owed upon cancellation are simple contract debts that may be set off against each other
