# Chapter 14: Requirement in Relation to Agents - Summary

## Overview
This chapter establishes strict requirements for firms appointing individuals as agents to carry out credit-related regulated activities. It mandates that firms can only appoint non-authorized individuals as agents under specific conditions, ensuring proper control, exclusivity, and full responsibility for the agent's conduct.

## Key Points and Main Findings

### Application
- **Scope**: Applies to all firms conducting credit-related regulated activities
- **Target**: Specifically addresses appointment of individuals (single human beings) who are not authorized or exempt persons

### Core Requirements for Agent Appointments (CONC 14.1.2 R)
- **Exclusivity requirement**: Individual must work as agent only for the appointing firm, not for any other principal
- **Written contract mandatory** containing:
  - Effective control measures over the agent's activities
  - Requirements for agent to clearly identify themselves as representing the firm
- **Financial responsibility**: For debt collection, payments received by agent are treated as received by the firm
- **Full liability**: Firm accepts complete responsibility for agent's conduct when acting on firm's behalf

### Compliance and Oversight (CONC 14.1.4 R)
- **Policy requirements**: Firms must establish, implement, and maintain adequate policies and procedures to ensure agent compliance
- **Conflict management**: Firms must take reasonable steps to identify conflicts of interest between agents and clients

## Important Details and Conclusions

- **Permission requirements**: Firms must hold Part 4A permission for every activity their agents perform that would require permission if performed directly by the firm
- **Continuous obligations**: All conditions must be met both at the time of appointment and throughout the entire agency relationship
- **Individual vs. entity**: The regulations specifically apply to individual human beings, not corporate entities or other legal persons
- **Customer transparency**: Agents must make their representative status and the principal firm's identity clear to all customers

This framework ensures proper oversight and accountability in credit-related activities conducted through agents, protecting consumers while maintaining clear lines of responsibility.
