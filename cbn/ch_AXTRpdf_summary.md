## Important Details and Conclusions

1. **Phased Implementation**: The transitional provisions demonstrate a carefully phased approach to implementing new consumer credit regulations, allowing firms adequate time to adjust systems and processes.

2. **Persistent Debt Focus**: Significant emphasis on addressing persistent debt in credit cards and retail revolving credit, with mandatory 18-month review cycles and escalating intervention requirements.

3. **Consumer Protection**: The provisions maintain consumer protection throughout transition periods, ensuring firms cannot exploit regulatory gaps.

4. **Record Keeping**: Comprehensive record-keeping requirements ensure accountability and enable regulatory oversight of consumer credit activities.

5. **Flexibility**: Firms could choose to implement new rules early but must then comply fully - no partial implementation allowed.
