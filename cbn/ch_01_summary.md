## Overview
This chapter establishes the scope and application of the Consumer Credit sourcebook (CONC), which sets out detailed obligations for credit-related regulated activities. It defines who CONC applies to, what activities it covers, where it applies geographically, and provides guidance on identifying customers in financial difficulties.

### Scope of Application
- **Applies to firms** conducting credit-related regulated activities and connected activities
- **Firms must ensure compliance** by employees, agents, and other persons acting on their behalf

## Important Details and Conclusions

The chapter emphasizes that CONC operates within a broader regulatory framework, with firms needing to pay particular attention to the Principles for Businesses, especially those relating to integrity, fair treatment of customers, clear communication, and delivering good customer outcomes. The guidance on financial difficulties provides practical indicators that firms should monitor to identify vulnerable customers who may need additional support or forbearance measures.
