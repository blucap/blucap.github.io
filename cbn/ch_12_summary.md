# Chapter 12 Summary: Requirements for Firms with Interim Permission for Credit-Related Regulated Activities

## Overview
This chapter establishes rules for firms operating with interim permissions for credit-related regulated activities. It specifies which provisions of the FCA Handbook apply, which are disapplied, and which are modified for these firms during their interim permission period.

## Key Points and Main Findings

### Scope and Application
- **Applies to:** All firms with interim permission status
- **Purpose:** To clarify regulatory requirements during the interim permission period
- **Effective date:** Rules relate to interim permissions granted on/after April 1, 2014

### Major Regulatory Modifications

#### **Disapplied Requirements:**
- **Senior Management (SYSC):**
  - No requirement to appoint compliance officer (debt management/credit repair firms)
  - Anti-money laundering systems and controls exemption
  - Money laundering reporting officer appointment not required

- **Supervision (SUP):**
  - Auditors, FCA Approved persons, and Appointed representatives rules don't apply
  - Exception: SUP3.10 and SUP3.11 apply for electronic lending systems

- **Client Assets (CASS):**
  - Does not apply if firms follow OFT366rev guidance (paragraphs 3.42-3.43)

- **Reporting Requirements:**
  - SUP16 largely doesn't apply except for SUP16.14
  - Complaints reporting rules (DISP1.10 and DISP1.10A) don't apply

- **Prudential Requirements:**
  - CONC10 (Prudential requirements for debt management firms) doesn't apply

#### **Modified Requirements:**
- **Fees:** Limited application of Fees manual
- **Threshold Conditions:** Apply with modifications reflecting the 2013 Order
- **Change Notifications:** Must use online Consumer Credit Interim Permissions system
- **Perimeter Guidance:** Modified to accommodate interim permission activities

## Important Details and Conclusions

### Legal Framework
- Interim permissions derive from the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Regulated Activities) (Amendment) (No 2) Order 2013
- Firms with interim permission have limited status - not considered full authorized persons for certain purposes
- The FCA/PRA retain powers to vary or cancel permissions if threshold conditions aren't met

### Practical Implications
- Firms with only interim permissions face reduced regulatory burden during transition
- Firms must use specific online systems for notifications and changes
- Different rules apply depending on whether a firm has:
  - Only an interim permission
  - An interim permission treated as a variation of existing permission

### Transition Considerations
- Applications for full Part 4A permission may incorporate activities under interim permission
- Firms cannot act as principals for activities under interim permission but may be appointed representatives for other activities
