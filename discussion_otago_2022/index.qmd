## What the paper finds ... {.smaller}

$PV = f(\text{Bank Presence})$, led by cooperative banks and savings banks. 

However, this relation varies across the different types of banks and is particularly pronounced for locally rooted banks with a mandate to promote the regional economy.

Banks substitute rather than complement government subsidies:

 

$\frac{\Delta Subsidies}{\Delta branch} = -981kEur$

What I like

-   Interesting results, great data used, results are sensible, novel.

Brief comments 

-   Why do borrowers pay 2.56 percent, while KfW charges 76 bp?
-   Do locals pressure banks to adjust lending standards [see @Vins2008; @CalomirisHaber2014].
-   Re policy recommendations: government can get it wrong, while there seems to be a functioning (albeit imperfectly) market.  
-   Lastly, as an aside: will demand for PV be the same in all parts of Germany?
-   Title mentions "opportunism"
